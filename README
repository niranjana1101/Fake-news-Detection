The system predicts the Fake news or mis-information. The dataset is divided
into training set and testing set and decision tree algorithm is applied. The accuracy is
calculated,actual and predicted values are compared. To help with the predictions you can draw a 
line, called a best-fit line that passes close to most of the data points. A heat map is a twodimensional representation of data in which values are represented by colors. A heat map provides
an immediate visual summary of information. More elaborate heat maps allow the viewer to
understand complex data sets. Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response
using a single feature. It is one of the most basic machine learning models that a machine learning
enthusiast get to know about. It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Logistic
regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the
Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a
given set of independent variables. Random forest classifier is an ensemble tree-based machine
learning algorithm. The random forest classifier is a set of decision trees from a randomly selected
subset of the training set. Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used
widely in Classification and Regression problems. It builds decision trees on different samples.
